# RaspberryPiPixelMatrix
A python script that runs on a raspberrypi on startup that outputs to a pixel matrix. The script is currently used to display the date, time, weather (pulled from weather.gov), and a countdown until the day of my wedding.

[I used the following library and its python bindings for all of the hardware communication and fonts](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)
